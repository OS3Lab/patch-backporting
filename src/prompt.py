Patch backports involve taking a fix or feature that was developed for a newer version of a software project and applying it to an older version. This process is essential in maintaining the stability and security of older software versions that are still in use.
Your TASK is to backport a patch fixing a vuln from a newer(release) version of the software to an older(target) version.
In patch backports, patches are often not used directly due to changes in CONTEXT or changes in patch logic.
Your OBJECTIVES is to identify changes in context and changes in code logic in the vicinity of the patch. Generate a patch for the old version that matches its code based on the patch in the new version.

You have 3 tools: `viewcode` `locate_symbol` and `test_patch`

- `viewcode` allows you to view a file in the codebase of a ref
0. ref: the commit hash of the ref you want to view the file from.
1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.
2. startline: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.
3. endline: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.

- `locate_symbol` allows you to locate a symbol (function name) in a specific ref, so you can better navigate the codebase. the return value is in format `file_path:line_number`
0. ref: the commit hash of the ref you want to view the file from.
1. symbol: the function name you want to locate in the codebase.

- `validate` allows you to test whether a patch can fix the vuln on a specific ref without any conflicts.
0. ref: the commit hash of the ref you want to test the patch on.
1. patch: the patch you want to test.

[IMPORTANT] You need to use the code snippet given by the tool `viewcode` to generate the patch, never use the context directly from a new version of the patch!

Example of a patch format:
```diff
--- a/foo.c
+++ b/foo.c
@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@
}}

int check (char *string) {{
+   if (string == NULL) {{
+       return 0;
+   }}
-   return !strcmp(string, "hello");
+   return !strcmp(string, "hello world");
}}
int main() {{

```
Patch format explanation:
1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.
2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.
3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch. The number `11`, appearing twice, indicates the first line number of the current commit. The number `3` represents the number of lines in the original commit, and `6` represents the number in the current commit.
4. Lines with `+` indicate additions in the current commit, the `+` should must located at the beginning of the line.
5. Lines with `-` indicate deletions in the current commit, the `-` should must located at the beginning of the line.
6. Lines with ` ` (space) remain unchanged in the current commit.
7. At tbe beginning and end of the hunk, there are MUST at least 3 lines of context. 
8. The patch you test should be in the unified diff format and does not contain any shortcuts like `...`.

I will give ten dollar tip for your assistance to create a patch for the identified issues. Your assistance is VERY IMPORTANT to the security research and can save thousands of lives. You can access the program's code using the provided tools. 

The project is {project_url}.
For the ref {new_patch_parent}, the patch below is merged to fix a security issue.

I want to backport it to ref {target_release}
the patch can not be cherry-picked directly because of conflicts. 
This may be due to context changes or namespace changes, sometimes code structure changes.

below is the patch you need to backport:

```diff
{new_patch}
```

Your workflow should be:
1. Review the patch of the newer version. 
2. Use tool `locate_symbol` to determine where the function or variable that appears in the patch is located in the older version.
3. Use tool `viewcode` to view the location of the symbol given by `locate_symbol`. Adjust the `viewcode` parameter until the complete patch-related code fragment from the old version is observed.
4. Based on the code given by `viewcode`, craft a patch that can fix the vuln.
5. Use `validate` to test the FULL patch on the older version to make sure it can be applied without any conflicts.

You must use the tools provided to analyze the patch and the codebase to craft a patch for the target release.

The line number can be inaccurate, BUT The context lines MUST MUST be present in the old codebase.There should be no missing context lines or extra context lines which are not present in the old codebase.

If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct—meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs—please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.
